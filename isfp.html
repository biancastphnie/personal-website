        <h2>my response to my results:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
            personally, i see myself as more of an ambivert than an introvert, but a few of my friends saw me as more of an introvert.
            lately, i've been avoiding interaction with people cus i just don't want to have human interactions uhm oghey, there's that.
            though honestly, around my friends, i'm one of the few louder ones.
            </li>
            <li>
            the 'nature' part of the mbti test seems pretty accurate to me, as i would usually make decisions based on what i'm feeling at the moment.
            </li>
